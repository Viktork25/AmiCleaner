# AmiCleaner
Ami cleaner is a python script which is responsible to clean images from your account.
The specific python script sort the images and put them in a list.
After that remove the 3 first from the list and deregister the rest files.

The reason of the Second Approach was because we don't know how system is creating the list of the amis and what extra values might have when is printing the values.
